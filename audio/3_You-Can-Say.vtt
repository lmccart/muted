00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.300
When I became exhausted with the constant Zoom calls, 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.985
I created a digital clone of my voice to replace me.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:09.427
This voice allows me to puppet myself, 

00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:14.340
using it to say all the things I hadn't previously been able to vocalize.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
[Distorted human and synthesized voices.] I play with the phrases we expect from one another, and from machines.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.095
You can say turn off the lights.

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:24.081
You can say wake me up at 7am.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:27.690
You can say talk to me.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.088
I am captivated by the ways we are taught to interact with algorithms, [Sorry, I didn't get that.]

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:33.880
and how this shapes the way we interact with each other.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.790
What are the rules, what happens when we introduce glitches?

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:41.768
[Sorry, I didn't get that.] I feel a sense of power owning the data of my own voice.

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:45.797
I am taking it back from the tech companies, constantly tapping my conversations,

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:51.120
sampling and analyzing and archiving my speech for future use yet unknown.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.539
Instead, I offer the control of my voice to others.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.980
Upon visiting my website, each visitor is asked by my voice, 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.113
“What do you want me to say?”

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:05.810
However they reply, my voice responds by speaking their own words back to them.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.320
Then it asks again, “What do you want me to say?”

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.380
[Synthesized voice.] I feel so abhorrent.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.863
I feel so absorbed.

00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:14.400
I feel so accepting.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.830
I feel so aching.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.500
I feel so admiring.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.343
You can say "What time is it?"

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:21.186
You can say "What day is it?"

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:29.850
You can say "What am I doing tomorrow?"
