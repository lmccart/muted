00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.870
In the foreground, a silhouette of shrubs frame Lauren in the midground.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.270
She lays in a sleeping bag in her friend’s backyard.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.676
Her form is disguised into the surrounding darkness 

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:18.860
apart from the light from her smartphone screen illuminating her face.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.674
An overhead light also shows traces of outdoor furniture behind her

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:34.440
and the fences that reveal the boundary of the backyard.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.630
The further I got into this series of voice experiments, the more I began to dissociate.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.550
It became hard to tell what existed beyond my computer screen.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.280
Months of caution began to induce feelings of extreme recklessness and futility.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.239
In a last ditch effort to get close, I sent text messages to friends.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:56.390
A holiday offering of my live body outside their home.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.517
We have only text communication.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.570
I spend the night out on their lawn.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.190
Each of us thinking of the other’s physicality.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.679
Seeking presence.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.757
Suddenly, my motion sensor lights turned off.

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:15.530
And your whole body disappeared into the night.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.275
Aside from your face which was illuminated by your phone that you held above you.

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:26.293
Slightly uneased and amused, I messaged you,

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:32.779
And I said, “I left the back door unlocked in case you need to use the restroom tonight.”

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:38.439
And the typing bubble appeared and I looked to see your fingers move across your screen in that instance.

00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:44.469
“Thanks!” you reply.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.220
I feel safety in this closeness at distance.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.909
While I’m thinking of all the others outside every night in more precarious positions.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.197
Last spring we witnessed extraordinary measures taken to provide housing and care.

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:02.845
Measures we were previously told were too hard and too expensive and would take too much time.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:08.910
As these safety nets are now being unravelled, how do we keep demanding support for the most vulnerable?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.000
Who are the people outside our homes that we choose to think of at night?
