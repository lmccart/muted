00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.577
After a year spent fearing for our health, grieving the loss of loved ones,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.951
watching the ever growing death counts, 

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:10.951
I have never felt so in touch with my own mortality.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.914
Drifting confused between utter stagnation and overwhelming transience,

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:18.000
I started Good Night.

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:23.548
A performance for one person that continues as long as I am alive.

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:28.145
Every night before sleep, I text the owner of the work “good night.”

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:32.424
At any point, that person may choose to pass the work to someone else,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.612
at which point the good night texts transfer to the next person.

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:42.684
It is the first in a series of rest-of-life performances I plan to complete.

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:49.816
What does it mean to commit, to something or someone, when the end is so palpable yet unknown?

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.768
This series of pandemic works are about 

00:00:51.768 --> 00:01:01.809
isolation, breakdown, danger, disconnection, grief, frustration, communication, wanting.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.275
Streaming ourselves through every possible channel, platform, and app, 

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.369
how do we hold the bits of each other together?
