00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.276
Encased in a white chat box with black monotype text is a statement 

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:14.633
“I think one day we will be able to go outside again.”

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:26.231
A down arrow follows the statement, prompting
the user to expand the context of the conversation.

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:32.400
As we waited in the middle of everything last March, I kept thinking about how “later” had taken on new importance.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.004
It had been elevated from that place to which
we’d relegate anything that did not really concern us 

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.884
to a place where we’d do everything.

00:00:38.884 --> 00:00:44.305
I built a web interface to facilitate a series of online chats with people 

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:48.909
where we would make plans for a “later date”, when we were able to go outside again.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.859
I fantasized about these later dates.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.661
Being in the same space as other people.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.791
Reaching out and touching.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.381
Shared surfaces.

00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.819
Breathing, talking, anything really.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.670
It is a performance in two parts.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.970
In the first, we chat and imagine together our first meeting.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.960
Where will we go, what will we do, what will we say?

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.850
This future plan gets saved as a sort of script.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.380
Later, when allowed out again, they receive a request to meet and we enact this script.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.530
This is part two.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.149
You were one of the last people I saw before the UCLA campus closed down that day.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.427
We were having grad reviews.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:40.528
We sat on a couch together looking at a jittery data visualization I made using flight data.

00:01:40.528 --> 00:01:45.644
Would it be that jittery if I took data just a few weeks later?

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:51.000
Everything in the room was dark, minus the projection light.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.596
The furniture was shifted around to accommodate my install.

00:01:55.596 --> 00:02:03.433
Changes to a familiar space seemed to add dramatic effect to what was going on outside the school walls.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:05.700
The future was looming in the air.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.600
We both wondered what would happen.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.077
Or if anything would happen at all. 

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:18.500
How would the events that were to unfold going to change our lives?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.220
We were planning with each other while we were negotiating with the future.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.159
What season will it be?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.239
Will we be able to embrace?

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.180
Will that place still exist?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.377
We talked about the first days when frantic decisions were being made,

00:02:31.377 --> 00:02:35.900
and each of our personal boundaries closing in as we began to feel unsafe with one another.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.563
We acknowledged the discomfort of trying to find a stable place in a situation we refuse to accept as normal.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.170
We make extremely specific plans, subject to change.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.630
Our conversation was the opposite of a Zoom grid.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.689
It was one-to-one, slow, text-only.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.880
I called this piece a performance, but with the camera off, it felt like the first non-performance I had experienced in weeks.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.910
The interaction is about waiting instead of streaming.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.129
And in this lack of bandwidth, we are left space to imagine.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:13.294
The person on the other end, whose presence we are only certain of at brief moments when messages pop onscreen.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.439
The later with this person when we will meet in highest fidelity.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:28.879
The days and months that will unfold after this exchange.
