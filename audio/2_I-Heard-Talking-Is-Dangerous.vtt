00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.674
Lauren stands on a patch of grass outside a home with her back towards the camera.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:11.611
Two young masked people stand at the top of a small set of stairs.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.339
At this distance, it is uncertain if they are looking at Lauren 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.682
or at the smartphone in Lauren’s left hand.

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:24.000
The phone is extended forward for legibility and rotated in landscape mode.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.357
All three people pictured are nicely dressed.

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:34.343
[A series of synthesized voices.] It is important to be kind during stressful times.

00:00:34.343 --> 00:00:38.460
It's hard to hold all these different contexts in mind.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.512
Anybody that can live in solitude is a powerful being.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:50.399
At a crowded supermarket, the panic was palpable.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.700
[Human voice.] This was the first in a series of gestures over the past year trying to deal with the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.931
profound isolation I felt, stuck behind screens,

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.670
backgrounded by a pervasive fear, suspended in time.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.067
I think most of us were feeling it.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:09.115
With the murder of George Floyd, that anxiety exploded into rage and grief that took over the streets,

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:13.345
simultaneously bringing us together and pushing us further apart. 

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:18.030
Our understanding of who is trustworthy, what is safe to do and talk about shifted.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.190
While the medical advice continued to evolve and update.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.190
Avoid surfaces.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.820
Check in with your friends.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.979
Don’t wear masks.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.979
Wear two.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.670
Don’t call, give them space.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.722
Keep six feet.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.024
Protest the right things.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.159
Don’t fly.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.627
Don’t talk politics.

00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:33.894
Restaurants are open,.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.759
Schools are unsafe.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:40.353
Feeling completely disconnected, I created I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS

00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:42.390
trying to break through.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.592
Showing up on doorsteps, I deliver a monologue via phone screen and text-to-speech.

00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:51.100
I explain that I just heard masks and six feet are not safe enough.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.200
Because when you speak, tiny particles fly out through your mask at high velocity.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.135
They’ve recommended we stop talking to each other.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:00.397
They say talking is dangerous.

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:02.370
So I made an alternative.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.810
I invite each person to visit a URL on their phone to continue the conversation.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.280
We proceed, discussing danger, safety, the future.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.227
Over the months we have learned to say things via text that perhaps

00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:17.890
we couldn't in a more embodied way.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.664
Could this form of typing-speaking open anything for us?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.050
[Series of synthesized voices.] Sometimes I feel like listening is more dangerous than talking.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.630
Is there really safety in distance?

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.658
Can we understand each other without talking?

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:43.880
[Human voice.] Ah, I remember how short I am again.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.191
I completely forgot what your lower body looked like.

00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:52.112
I never thought I needed to remember.

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:55.926
Sorry, I can’t read that fast.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.315
Can you bring the phone a little closer?

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:03.434
Is the audio up all the way?

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:07.321
I keep wondering, in moments before laughter,

00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:13.242
when our gut is about to push out air from our mouths with a force greater than speaking,

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:16.724
How will we compose ourselves then?

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.579
[Synthesized voice.] I care about you immensely.
